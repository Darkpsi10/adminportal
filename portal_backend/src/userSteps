STEPS:

1. create folders
2. configure index.ts
   - establish db connection and links, ports, etc
3. configure userModels.ts
   - create model using sequelize.define, export it
4. configure userController.ts
   - establish err/success status for post (use build and save instead of create if some checking needs to be done, or just pass the whole create in an if then )
5. configure userRoutes.ts
   - use multer to configure image upload
   - import registeruser from usercontroller to upload image
   - .post() to upload data
6. now for get methods
   - go back to controller.ts
   - create getUser and getUsers methods, export
   - go to routes.ts
   - create two .get() routes for both of them
7. for delete methods
   - get user details by findbypk(number(req.body.id))
   - delete using destroy, also do fs.unlink for any files
8. for put method
   - get user details by findbypk(number(req.body.id))
   - put req.query in update directly as it in the same format that sequelize accepts
   - make sure you include the case for image updation-> update image_path, new image in folder + fs.unlink previous image
